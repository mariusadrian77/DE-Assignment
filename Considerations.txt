Edge cases:

1. User Activity Spanning Multiple Days: If a user remains active beyond a single day but within the session timeout window (cross-day sessions).
Solution:
Focus on the time difference between events rather than the date. If the time difference between consecutive events is less than the session timeout, 
treat it as a single continuous session, even if the interaction spills over into the next calendar day.


2. Different Devices: If a user accesses the website from multiple devices (different user-agent values), separating sessions per device or handling them as a single session if they occur close in time might be an option.
Solutions: 

a. Sessions across different devices should be merged (i.e., consider it part of the same user journey).
b. Sessions from different devices should be separated, treating them as distinct sessions.
c. Combined approach: If a user switches devices within a very short period (e.g., less than 2 minutes), merge the sessions.
    If the switch happens after a longer period, split the sessions.

Most important decision is the session_timeout.

Business Considerations and User Behavior:
The session timeout should also be aligned with the nature of the business and the user behavior expected on the site.

Type of Interaction: If users are mostly browsing or exploring (e.g., an e-commerce site), 
                     a shorter session timeout like 15-30 minutes might be appropriate, as users tend to make decisions quickly.

Complex Tasks: If users engage in complex tasks (e.g., reading long articles, watching videos, or comparing products), 
               a longer timeout (e.g., 30-60 minutes) might be more appropriate.

Industry Benchmarks: Compare sessionization strategy to industry standards. 
                     For example, e-commerce websites often use a 30-minute timeout, 
                     but some platforms (like social networks or educational platforms) may allow longer timeouts, up to 60 minutes.




From the session duration plots here are the key observations and takeaways:

1. High Frequency of Short Sessions:
Across all the plots (for different session timeouts), there is a very high concentration of sessions that last less than 1 minute.
This indicates that a significant portion of users interact with the website in a very short burst, possibly quickly checking something or leaving after a single or a few actions.

2. Long Tail of Sessions:
After the 1-minute mark, the session frequency drops significantly, but there is a long tail of sessions lasting up to 30 minutes or more.
These longer sessions are much less frequent but could represent engaged users who are spending more time on the site (e.g., browsing products, reading content).

3. Similar Shape Across Different Timeouts:
The overall shape of the session duration distribution is similar across different timeouts (5 to 10 minutes), which indicates that most sessions are short regardless of the session timeout value.
However, a shorter timeout (like 5 minutes) leads to slightly more sessions being broken up, compared to a longer timeout (10 minutes), where more sessions are captured as longer durations.

4. Diminishing Returns Beyond 10 Minutes:
The results suggest that most meaningful user activity happens within the first few minutes. Therefore, using a timeout of more than 10 minutes might not add significant value, as the longer sessions do not significantly increase after this point.
5 to 10 minutes seems to be a good range for session timeout based on the data. A longer timeout could be useful to merge very occasional actions into one session, but a shorter timeout (5 minutes) seems to capture most real user engagement.


A session timeout of 5 to 7 minutes would likely capture most user behavior without splitting sessions unnecessarily.
A more conservative approach of 10 minutes could be a safe upper limit, but anything beyond that appears to add diminishing returns based on the long tail of session durations.
Thus, a session timeout of 8 minutes would be the middle-ground
